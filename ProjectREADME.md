  # Readme Generator

  ## Description

  This is a backend application that generates a readme file based on the user inputs.  The application uses node.js and is run using the terminal.  Upon the user initilizing the file they are prompted with a series of questions about their project.  After all the prompts are answered a new readme file will be created.  This ReadMe was created using the generator.
